# The Glucose Games

The Glucose Games are a series of games and contests meant to help people with diabetes optimize their control of blood sugar levels.
These are the first games of their kind, using your blood sugar to control the experiences.
Compete with yourself to improve your control over time, or (in the future) compete with others to see how you stack up against the community.

## How it works

The first step is getting your blood sugar levels hooked up to the games. 
In order to play the game you will need to have a Dexcom continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and you will need to be connected to Dexcom's Clarity service.
The games will pull your blood sugar data from the Dexcom API.

## The games

Compete across a broad array of games and contests, including:

- **Longest Streak**: Keep track of the longest time you've kept your blood sugar in range, and try to beat it!
- **Daily Streaks**: Keep your blood sugar almost perfect for as many days in a row as you can.
- **Sleeping Sound**: Keep your night time blood sugar in the optimal range as much as possible.

Check out a demo of the games [here](/demo).

## Track your progress (Coming Soon)

As you compete in the games, you'll be able to track your progress over time.
See how your control has improved, and where you might need to focus more attention.

## The community (Coming Soon)

While all the games can be played solo, you can also compete against others anonymously in ranked contests.
See how the power of competition can help you improve your control over time!
Use your avatar to represent yourself, and unlock new avatars and looks as you compete in more games and reach new milestones.

## Data privacy

We take your privacy seriously.
For the most part the only data we store are the scores for contests you've competed in, and the rewards you've earned since you started playing.
At this time we do not store your blood sugar data, and we will not share that data with anyone else.
Only the competition data you choose to share will be shared with others.

You can delete your account at any time, and **all** of your data will be removed from our system.
If you have concerns about your data, please reach out to us at [privacy@glucose.games](mailto:privacy@glucose.games).

## Status

The Glucose Games are currently in development.
