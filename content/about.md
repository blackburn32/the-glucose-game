# The Glucose Games

The Glucose Games are a series of games and contests meant to help people with diabetes optimize their control of blood sugar levels.
These are the first games of their kind, using your blood sugar to control the experiences.
Compete with yourself to improve your control over time, or compete with others to see how you stack up against the community.

## How it works

The first step is getting your blood sugar levels hooked up to the games. 
In order to play the game you will need to have a Dexcom continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and you will need to be connected to Dexcom's Clarity service.
The games will pull your blood sugar data from Clarity and use it to control the game.

## The games

Compete across a broad array of games and contests, including:

- **Glucose Sprint**: Keep your blood sugar as close to your optimal range as possible for a set period of time.
- **Glucose Marathon**: Slow and steady is the name of the game, as you try to keep your blood sugar in the optimal range for as long as possible.
- **The Floor is Lava**: Don't go low! Keep your blood sugar above the low threshold for as long as possible.
- **Watch Your Head**: Avoid highs! Keep your blood sugar below the high threshold for as long as possible.

Play as many games at a time as you'd like.
Check back regularly to enter community based contests and see how you stack up against others.

## Track your progress

As you compete in the games, you'll be able to track your progress over time.
See how your control has improved, and where you might need to focus more attention.

## The community

While all the games can be played solo, you can also compete against others anonymously in ranked contests.
See how the power of competition can help you improve your control over time!
Use your avatar to represent yourself, and unlock new avatars and looks as you compete in more games and reach new milestones.

## The rewards

Unlock new avatars, badges and more as you compete in the games, against yourself and against others.
Earn rewards for things like:
- Competing in your first game

## Data privacy

We take your privacy seriously.
For the most part the only data we store are the scores for contests you've competed in, and the rewards you've earned since you started playing.
We do not store your blood sugar data, and we do not share that data with anyone else.
Only the competition data you choose to share will be shared with others.

You can delete your account at any time, and **all** of your data will be removed from our system.
If you have concerns about your data, please reach out to us at [privacy@glucose.games](mailto:privacy@glucose.games).
